Chart Builder
=============

A web interface for the [ABC News dailygraphics fork](https://github.com/abcnews/dailygraphics), for use by non-technical editors.

Dependancies
------------

This checkout requires the following sub directories:

-	`/dailygraphics/` - a checkout of [abcnews/dailygraphics](https://github.com/abcnews/dailygraphics)
-	`/graphics/` - where the "graphics" generated by the dailygraphics tool go
-	`/bootstrap/` - bootstrap framework used by chart builder tool (local copy to avoid ABC network issues)

Hosted tool
-----------

This tool is hosted on the newsdev3 server inside the ABC network. It can be accessed via http://newsdev3.aus.aunty.abc.net.au/tools/chart-builder/

Updates to this repo need to be manually pulled down to newsdev3 by shelling in:

```
ssh nd@newsdev3.aus.aunty.abc.net.au
```

When shelled in:

```
cd /var/www/html/tools/chart-builder
git pull
```

Same for the `dailygraphics` dependency:

```
cd /var/www/html/tools/chart-builder/dailygraphics
git pull
```

Deployment
----------

The `chart-builder` codebase is hosted on [newsdev3](https://confluence.abc-dev.net.au/display/NEWSDEV/newsdev3). Deploying updates it is simply a matter of logging in there and doing a `git pull` on the master branch.

If our [Git Workflow](https://confluence.abc-dev.net.au/display/NEWSDEV/Git+Workflow) is being properly observed, this should work just fine.

TODO: This process is simple, but quite poor practice. A more robust release procedure would be useful.

When working with `chart-builder` you may also need to make changes to [dailygraphics](https://github.com/abcnews/dailygraphics/) which is the front-end for non-technical users to build charts using `dailygraphics`.
