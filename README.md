# Chart Builder

A web interface for the ABC News dailygraphics fork, for use by non-technical editors.

## Dependancies

This checkout requires the following sub directories:

* `/dailygraphics/` - a checkout of [abcnews/dailygraphics](https://github.com/abcnews/dailygraphics)
* `/graphics/` - where the "graphics" generated by the dailygraphics tool go
* `/bootstrap/` - bootstrap framework used by chart builder tool (local copy to avoid ABC network issues)

## Hosted tool

This tool is hosted on the newsdev3 server inside the ABC network. It can be accessed via http://newsdev3.aus.aunty.abc.net.au/tools/chart-builder/

Updates to this repo need to be manually pulled down to newsdev3 by shelling in:

    ssh nd@newsdev3.aus.aunty.abc.net.au

When shelled in:

    cd /var/www/html/tools/chart-builder
    git pull

Same for the `dailygraphics` dependency:

    cd /var/www/html/tools/chart-builder/dailygraphics
    git pull
